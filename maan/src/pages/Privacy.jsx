        <b> Cookies:</b> A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s
        computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no
        way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
        We use session ID cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close
        the browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies are used to maintain
        the identity of users with our site after users log in with a username
        and password. This allows the users to identify themselves (log in) once
        rather than multiple times per web session. You can choose to disable
        cookies by following the procedure suggested by your particular browser.
        If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you may still be able
        to access our site depending on where you are on our site. This
        information shall be compiled and analyzed to enhance our products and
        services and shall not be used in any way to identify our
        clients/customers personally. Except as specifically described in this
        privacy policy, we will not, without clients'/customers' prior consent,
        sell any information such as Non-Public Information or Personally
        Identifiable Information to any third parties other than authorized
        third parties and others involved in the e-commerce distribution chain
        (e.g., vendors, suppliers), which may need access to some of your
        personal information. For example, if we ship an order to you, we must
        share your name and address with a shipping company. We do not give
        access to data on individual transactions to third parties, other than
        as described in this privacy policy. Communications of Information: We
        at Maanz AI shall ensure to preserve user privacy, however, there are
        certain circumstances where Maanz AI may need to disclose personal
        information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief
        that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial
        proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on our products,
        services, or website. Maanz AI uses links to other sites in its websites
        offered as part of services to different clients. Please be aware that
        Maanz AI shall not be responsible for the privacy practices of such
        other sites. We encourage clients/customers to be aware that once
        redirected to external sites either voluntarily or involuntarily, read
        the privacy statements of each and every website that collects
        personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies
        solely to information collected by Maanz AI as part of its engagement of
        products or services or websites with its customers and clients.
        Whenever Maanz AI collects sensitive information such as credit card
        numbers and billing information, such information is encrypted and is
        protected with industry-standard encryption technology. To prevent
        unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure proper use of
        information, Maanz AI has put in place appropriate physical, electronic,
        and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we
        collect in our applications. All of our users’ information, not just the
        sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
        Maanz AI, keeping in view the privacy of personal information received
        from minors/children (individuals under the age of 18), shall not
        knowingly receive/collect personal information at company portals and
        websites. If Maanz AI comes to know that there is personal information
        received from a minor available at company portals and websites, it
        shall be deleted. In case a customer or client's personally identifiable
        information changes (such as zip code, phone, email, or postal address),
        or if a client no longer continues to use the service, Maanz AI shall
        correct, update, or delete users’ personally identifiable information.
        Maanz AI ensures to notify changes to its clients in its privacy policy,
        all such changes are posted as part of this privacy statement, on our
        website and other places we deem appropriate so our users, customers,
        and clients are always aware of what information we collect, how we use
        it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however,
        we are going to utilize our users’ PII/NPI in a manner different from
        that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a
        notice for change on our website for 30 days. In the event any of the
        provisions of this privacy policy are held to be unenforceable, the
        remaining provisions will be unimpaired and the unenforceable
        provision(s) will be replaced by such enforceable provision(s) as comes
        closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision(s).
